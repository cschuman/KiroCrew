"""Restart recovery of the Subagents panel is seeded by the real slot-restore path.

The Subagents panel rebuilds from persisted run folders on a replaced gateway.
Every admission path on that rebuild requires ``state.get_slot(slot_key)`` to
answer non-None -- a slot that does not exist denies, by design, fail-closed. So
recovery depends on the slot being live: a persisted run reappears only if its
slot has been restored. The unit tests covering the panel
(``test_subagent_panel_durable_replay.py``) hand-register their slots -- they
verify the frames and the records, but the slot never arrives through the
production seeding path, so neither the restore step nor the fail-closed gate is
exercised against a slot that a real boot rebuilt.

This closes that gap the only way a unit test cannot: a real gateway RESTART
(a second boot on the same home) whose slot arrives through the production
seeding path -- ``restore_open_slots`` rehydrating ``open_slots.json`` during
boot -- rather than a hand-registered one. The test pins two things:

* ``restore_open_slots`` rebuilds the slot on a replacement boot, so a persisted
  run owned by that slot replays over the reconnect; and
* the fail-closed ``slot_missing`` gate withholds a persisted run whose owning
  slot was never seeded.

The integration layer is the right home for it: ``gateway_boot`` boots the real
``GatewayOrchestrator.run()`` in this process, ``restart()`` is a genuine second
boot on the SAME ``KIROCREW_HOME`` with every home-bound global reset between
them exactly as a new process starts without them, and the live
``DashboardState`` is reachable for a direct assertion that the slot really was
seeded. The subprocess E2E route proves the same thing across a process
boundary; this proves it a step cheaper and asserts the seam the unit tests
cannot -- ``get_slot`` non-None at replay time, produced by seeding and not by a
test hand-registering it.

The shape:

1. plant a dashboard slot's transcript on the home (one metadata line, one
   message) -- the production seeding input ``restore_open_slots`` reads;
2. plant that slot's key in ``open_slots.json`` and a persisted subagent run
   folder owned by that slot's session (the ``subagents/<id>/`` tree a finished
   persistent run leaves behind, the same shape
   ``test_subagent_panel_durable_replay`` writes);
3. ``restart()`` -- a genuine second boot on the same home, which does not
   re-seed, so those two files are the replacement boot's recovery input;
4. assert ``get_slot`` is non-None on the new boot (seeding ran), then subscribe
   the Subagents panel over the owner WebSocket and read until the persisted
   run's ``subagent_done`` frame arrives.

The negative control plants the same record under a slot with no
``open_slots.json`` entry: nothing restores it, ``get_slot`` answers None, and
the fail-closed ``slot_missing`` gate withholds the frame. A second run owned by
the real seeded slot is planted as a replay-completion beacon, so the control
reads until the replay is observably finished before asserting the unseeded run
is absent -- the withholding is proven, never an idle socket mistaken for an
empty panel.
