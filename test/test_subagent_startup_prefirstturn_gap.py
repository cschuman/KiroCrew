"""Characterization tests for the pre-first-turn reaper coverage gap.

A subagent shown as ``starting`` is registered but has not advanced past
turn 0. Two watchdogs are meant to bound that state:

* the fast startup watchdog (:meth:`SubagentManager._is_startup_stalled`,
  window :data:`_STARTUP_TIMEOUT_SECS`), and
* the stuck-wave sweep (:meth:`SubagentManager._sweep_stuck_waves`).

This file covers two pre-execution states against the reaper's bounds.
The first is a wave member still sitting in the spawn
queue (``_queue``, never in ``_agents``): it is failed only when a run holding
a concurrency slot is positively wedged, judged by the same
:meth:`SubagentManager._stall_verdict` oracle the running members use, enforced
by :meth:`SubagentManager._sweep_stranded_queue_entries` from the reaper loop.
A busy slot held by a healthy long run is never read as a strand. The tests
below assert that coverage; a direct test of the sweep is added at the end.

The second state -- a registered run with ``_exec_started is None`` (e.g. parked
on a spawn approval) -- is deliberately NOT bounded by a fast reaper here: it is
owned by the approval window (2 h on the dashboard/Slack paths), which denies an
unanswered prompt and ends the run as ``spawn rejected``. Those tests still pin
that the reaper's per-agent loop adds no shorter bound, which is correct and
intended.
