"""The freestyle agent-task spawn path backs off when the HOST declines.

The ``route == "execute"`` block in ``_do_poll`` spawns freestyle tasks
serially. On ``origin/main`` a declined spawn (the admission gate deferring for
low memory, surfaced as a raised ``SpawnError``) leaves the due task undone, so
it re-attempts on EVERY one-second poll with no backoff — the reported
~400 attempts/min storm.

The fix backs off ONLY on a decline: a raised ``SpawnError`` arms a cooldown
during which no freestyle spawn is attempted, and a SUCCESSFUL spawn clears it
at once. A healthy host whose spawns succeed is never throttled — the hourly
``activity_budget`` meter (recorded only after a successful spawn, see
``hooks.py``) is deliberately left untouched by this path.
